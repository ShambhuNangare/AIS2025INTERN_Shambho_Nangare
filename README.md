# Task 9
  Task Overview  
  Naive Bayes Classifier on Iris Data  
  This task implements and compares three variants of Naive Bayes classifiers (GaussianNB, BernoulliNB, and MultinomialNB) using the Iris dataset:  
  * Data Preprocessing:  
    * Split the dataset into dependent and independent variables.  
    * Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.  
  * Models:  
    * Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB): Assumes features follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.  
    * Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB): Assumes binary features (0 or 1).  
    * Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB): Best for count-based features, often used in text classification.  
  * Steps:  
    * Train the models.  
    * Make predictions on the test set.  
    * Evaluate model performance using accuracy scores.  

# Task 10
  Task Overview  
  This task is an implementation of a Decision Tree classifier for classification tasks. It uses two splitting criteria:  
  * Entropy (Information Gain): Chooses the feature that reduces uncertainty in the data the most.
  * Gini Index: Chooses the feature that minimizes impurity.
  The model also calculates performance metrics such as:  
  * Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions.
  * Recall: The ability to identify all relevant instances.
  * Precision: The proportion of positive predictions that are correct
